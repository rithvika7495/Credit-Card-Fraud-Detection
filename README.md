# Credit Card Fraud Detection 

This is a machine learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using various algorithms. The dataset used in this project contains a total of 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent. The aim of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle. It contains a total of 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 0.17% of the transactions being fraudulent.
