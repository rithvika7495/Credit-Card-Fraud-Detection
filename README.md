# Credit Card Fraud Detection

🔍 This project focuses on developing a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

📝 Credit card fraud is a prevalent issue that affects individuals and businesses worldwide. The goal of this project is to build a robust model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions and minimize financial losses.

🔒 The dataset used for training and evaluation contains a large number of credit card transactions, including both genuine and fraudulent transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a small proportion of fraudulent transactions compared to genuine ones.

## Features

🔢 The dataset consists of various features extracted from credit card transactions, such as transaction amount, time of transaction, and anonymized numerical features derived from the transaction details.

## Model Development

🔧 Multiple machine learning algorithms are explored and evaluated for their effectiveness in detecting credit card fraud. The models are trained using a combination of oversampling techniques, anomaly detection methods, and ensemble learning approaches.

## Evaluation Metrics

📊 The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, ROC curves and AUC (Area Under the Curve) are used to assess the models' ability to balance between true positive rate and false positive rate.

## Dependencies

🛠️ The project relies on the following libraries and frameworks:

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy 🧮
- pandas 🐼
- scikit-learn 🧪
- Matplotlib 📊

## Getting Started

🚀 To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the credit card transaction dataset (provide a link or instructions on where to obtain the dataset).
4. Preprocess the dataset (provide instructions if any preprocessing is required).
5. Train the models: `python train.py`
6. Evaluate the models: `python evaluate.py`

📝 Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different techniques to improve the fraud detection accuracy.
